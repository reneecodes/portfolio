# Renee Martinez - Lead UI/UX Designer Portfolio ✨

## 🎨 The Vision
Renee Martinez is a Lead UI/UX Designer specializing in turning "information overload" into intuitive, beautiful digital experiences. She believes that the best designs are the ones that feel like they aren't even there. 

This portfolio has been completely revamped to reflect a **Senior Designer's aesthetic**, featuring:
- **Sophisticated Glassmorphism:** High-end transparency and blur effects.
- **Unified Canvas Background:** A sleek radial gradient that stays fixed as you scroll.
- **Fluid CSS Animations:** Staggered entrance effects and smooth micro-interactions.
- **Modern Typography:** Optimized for legibility and visual hierarchy.
